# VeryMuchToDo

## Firebase, MVVM, Databinding Android application.

In the first phase, Firestore and Authentification are used.

The application works as a todo-service and each change on any device in the todo-list are automatically displayed on all connected Android devices.

You can check the task as done or uncheck it, and delete list when finished all tasks.

There is also a simple messenger that displays all new messages on all devices instantly.

The application also uses Firebase Authentification for login, but without any security checkings.

There is plenty of room for extensions and adding new functions, for example, chat rooms in messenger, private messages, a to-do list for groups, personal to-do lists, etc...

Also is possible to add Firebase Cloud Messaging service for notifications.

As mentioned before, this is a test and training app and a purpose is to test some technologies and services in Android app development, but there are always possibilities to modify it with different functions for different purposes.



TODO in next revisions:
- push notifications
- local notifications
- group messages
- map actions
- onLocation events
- user interactions(call, send mail)
- ???
